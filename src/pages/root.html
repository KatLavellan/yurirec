			<h2>Why</h2>
			<p>So. I think it's really hard to find stuff, no matter the genre, that actually connects with you or fits your tastes. Simply having a rating system from 1-10 hides a lot of nuance, and just rates it by general quality, not what you're into. A manga could have the highest possible rating, and be tagged gl, and then have bare nuggets of romance. Or a manga can be tagged really low because it's on the edge of what people are comfortable with. Thus, the goal is simply to rate it on a lot of different spectrums, like the quality of the art, how funny it is, how emotional it is, etc. in the hope that anyone can find what they like in this big ol' list.</p>
			<h2>What Rating Mean</h2>
			Most are straightforward but a few I want to explain a little better:</br>
			</br><b>uniqueness</b></br>
			Whether a manga stands out in the crowd. A manga about two office workers, or a manga between two high school students are going to get a low score, unless they aggressively commit to the concept and stand out.</br>
			</br><b>intensity</b></br>
			Intensity implies emotional intensity. If something made me cry, it has a higher intensity. If it constantly gets me to laugh, high intensity. If it does both. 10/10 intensity. 
			</br></br><b>freaky</b></br>
			Freaky is horny without the horny. Something like 6th Degree isn't exactly dealing with sex. But it still has, to some degree, bdsm dynamics (being pushed around, treated like a dog, etc.). Thus, freaky.

			<h2>Length?</h2>
			Length is subjective. Largely, I maintain 1-20 chapters is short, 20-60 is medium, 60+ is long. These metrics are skewed by how long chapters are. Girlfriend Manual is 80 chapters but you can read a chapter in half a minute. I'd call it medium, still.
			<h2>Pairing/Gender Scores</h2>
			I rate each item, per relationship, and score them. So, a comic where two protagonists make out sloppy style. 10. 6, to me, is sufficient. So, anything below a 6 does not meet the lesbian requirement. Generally they'll be listed as 10s. If a comic is early enough, it might not be a 10 yet, because you can't guarantee where the author is heading with it, and sometimes I trust it well enough.
